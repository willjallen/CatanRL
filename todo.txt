- Fix longest road length
- Add non human agent debug view

- Saving states for undo, analysis and training
- Arenas, matchmaking and ELO

Network Related:
- Seperate network for initial placements?



Done:
- Implement initial placement actions
	- Add initial road placement function to account for the fact that initial roads can only be placed off the last building, not any other road or building

- Add road building dev card functionality
	- Ended up just making a new place_road action, breaking it into two steps

	-X In order to facilitate masking at runtime, permutations of the second road would need to be done for each permutation of the first road
	-X Might have to redo the entire purchase_play building into seperate purchase and play priority action (to preserve only having one set of (r,i) output neurons)
- Dev card can only be played at least a turn after it was purchased
