Game Engine Related:
-** Fix longest road length
	- If two roads owned by a player are seperated by an empty edge,
	there is an issue with using a two-point system to define a road and allowing
	either point to constitute a connection. The connection will jump across the gap.
- Add non human agent debug view
- Saving states for undo, analysis and training
- Arenas, matchmaking and ELO
-** Test cases
	-** Longest road

Network Related:
- Seperate network for initial placements?

- Edge case: road point pairs are empty when map is full of roads

Done:
- Implement initial placement actions
	- Add initial road placement function to account for the fact that initial roads can only be placed off the last building, not any other road or building

- Add road building dev card functionality
	- Ended up just making a new place_road action, breaking it into two steps

	-X In order to facilitate masking at runtime, permutations of the second road would need to be done for each permutation of the first road
	-X Might have to redo the entire purchase_play building into seperate purchase and play priority action (to preserve only having one set of (r,i) output neurons)

- Dev card can only be played at least a turn after it was purchased
